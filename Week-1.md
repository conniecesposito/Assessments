### Week 1 Assessment

These are potential interview questions. Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online.

#### 1. One great resource for learning Javascript is Eloquent Javascript - read this chapter on functions (http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) and list a few thoughts, questions, or things you learned here:

The article stated "A good mental model is to think of function values as containing both the code in their body and the environment in which they are created. When called, the function body sees the environment in which it was created, not the environment in which it is called." This was really helpful because I had not thought about it that way before.



#### 2. What is a linter for? Do you think they are useful? Explain why/why not.

A linter is a tool that analyzes your code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. I think it is helpful because it increases code quality and will help you avoid errors.


#### 3. Explain local vs global scope in programming. Feel free to create a code example to support your answer.

  Anything in a global scope is visible and accessible throughout the program. Anything that is inside a specific function can only be used in that specific function.


#### 4. Another great resource for more practice writing code is Free Code Camp. Their Javascript section starts here (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) - do at least 5 exercises.

Was this extra practice helpful? Take note of any concepts you learned or felt you understood better because of this resource.

  I do think the extra practice is very helpful. 

#### 5. Complete the steps for pushing changes to Github, assuming that the directory you are working in is already a git repo:

- git add .
- git _commit -m  " "_______________
- git ___push__________ -u origin master

#### 6. List some differences between return and console.log in Javascript. When would you use one vs the other?

console.log sends message to the console and is no longer useable by your program. Return can be passed and it exits the function. When you you have a return you find yourself in new scope. Any code that comes after function will no be run.

#### 7. Think back to the intro to Javascript presentation. We talked about Javascript being a "Dynamically Typed" language. What did this mean about the way we write Javascript?

It means that it is run line by line, top to bottom.
